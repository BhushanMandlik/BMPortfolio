How to improve your technical skills
If you’re changing industries or positions, you may need to consider improving on or acquiring new abilities. There are several steps you can take to improve your technical skills.

1. Enroll in courses for different skills
Most technical skills can be learned through a dedicated training program or class. Depending on the type of skill, you may be able to learn that skill taking one or more courses, either online or in person. There are free and paid classes available online.

2. Use a self-study training program
There’s a chance you may be able to acquire different skills through self-study programs. That could include “how-to” books, self-paced online lessons, or free training materials available from different sources.

3. Learn from a professional
You may be able to locate a professional who already possesses the technical skills you want. If so, that individual may be able to help teach you the skills you’re looking for, either for free or for compensation.

4. Learn on the job
Some employers may be able to provide on-the-job training. If you do not have certain technical skills an employer desires, make it known that you are eager to learn whatever skills are necessary to effectively perform the job.
